## Features
- View and copy color codes in different formats
- Select exact pixel in `Zoomview` with mouse or keyboard post-capture
- Global hotkey to start/pause capture _(currently hardcoded to `CTRL+Spacebar`)_
- Window always-on-top toggle
- Intuitive, easy-to-use UI
- Restore program state on reboot  

## Installation 

#### Requirements:
- Windows only
- [.NET 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) if running locally    
  
#### Download .exe
- Download the latest release from the [Releases](#) page  

#### Build from source
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/Peppson/color-picker.git"
cd "color-picker"
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -o "$HOME/Desktop"
```

#### Run locally
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/Peppson/color-picker.git"
cd "color-picker"
dotnet run -c Release 
```

### Considerations
- Should it capture its own window colors? _(currently off)_
- Auto-copy last capture to clipboard?
- Option to change global hotkey? _(Windows hook)_
