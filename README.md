## Getting Started

#### Requirements:
- Windows
- [.NET 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) _(if running locally)_    

<!-- 
#### Microsoft Store
- Link here TODO
-->
  
#### Download .exe
- Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Peppson/color-picker/releases) page  

#### Build from source
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/Peppson/color-grab.git"
cd "color-grab/colorPicker"
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -o "$HOME/Desktop"
```

#### Run locally
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/Peppson/color-grab.git"
cd "color-grab/colorPicker"
dotnet run -c Release 
```

### Considerations
- Auto-copy last capture to clipboard?
- Change `ZoomView` to use GPU accelareted capture?
- Keep sampling active with no mouse movement, to capture say a video?
- WPF is hard-capped at 60 FPS, such a shame...
